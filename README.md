# Street-and-Park-App
This was my final project for my class on Udemy. It involves the basics of ES6 along with default parameters, maps, and classes.
I thought that this was a fun project to do which explained the concepts of ES6 really well for someone who had never used this
edition of JavaScript before. I encourage anyone who is learning JS for the first time to take Jonas Schmedtmann's The Ultimate JS Bootcamp
on Udemy. He's really knowledgable about the subject and is very informative in his lectures.
